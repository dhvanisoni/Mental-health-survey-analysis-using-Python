This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 
There are a total of 26 columns and 1259 entries in the dataset.

We see that except the age column, all the columns are of object datatype.

Data Cleaning:

In dataset four columns has null values - state (515), self_employed (18), work_interfere (264), comments (1095)

we will drop the timestamp column because it's contains date, month, year and time the respondent took this questionnaire, which is irrelevant for us.
Comment column seems to contain most number ( 70% ) of null values, which makes sense because it was an optional text box so it's reasonable to expect that many (most) respondents would leave it blank.

So, drop columns from datasets that are not useful. drop timestamp and comments and create new dataframe.

The state column also contains a lot of null values. We'll not need that column also.
we have state columns only for United states 

Handle missing values in self_employed column and work_interfere column by filling null values.

Create new_df and keep only relevent columns which are useful in our analysis.
(Age, Gender, Country, remote_work, self_employed, tech_company, 
phys_health_interview, mental_health_interview, mental_health_consequence, phys_health_consequence, family_history, treatment, benefits, wellness_program)

Reason for selecting  these variables:
Mentle illness is very relevent to person's age, gender and work. 
Sometimes it depends on person's work, whether he/she is working in remotely or in workplace,whether he/she is self-employes or not, whether he/she working in tech-company or not.
Family history also play major role in mentle disorder.
